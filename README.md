This is my brand new REACT and TAILWIND portfolio created to make a cleaner experience than my old website.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I ran into some issues using another framework, so I switched over to next.js and it works wonderfully. However, I was not able to implement as much as I would have liked to for this project due to that hiccup. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I have added a few animations and functionalities to make this way more friendly towards users. One thing I will add soon after submission is deployed versions of past projects.

I am still working on this project and will be adding more features as I go along as mentioned.
